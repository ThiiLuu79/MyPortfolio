                    <p>As part of the <b>High Performance Databases (LOG660)</b> course, we were tasked with developing an application named <b>Webflix</b>, 
                        allowing clients to rent movies in accordance with their subscriptions. Our data management required the utilization of an Oracle database, 
                        and interaction with this data was achieved through an object-oriented program. 
                        This assignment was structured in two phases. 
                        <br>
                        In the initial phase, we focused on designing class and relational diagrams for the application, 
                        tailored to various use cases. Additionally, we were responsible for importing a vast amount of data into the database from an XML file containing 
                        thousands of entries.
                        <br>
                        For the second phase of this assignment, our task was to design and develop a user interface (UI) for the application. Within this interface, 
                        clients could log in to access detailed information about movies, actors and directors. Moreover, clients with eligible subscriptions had the ability to rent movies.

                        program a chain of production that produce airplanes. In this simulation, 
                        different factories are needed to produce airplanes. For instance, metal factories are needed 
                        to create metal. The metal will be sent to wing and engine factories to create those components. Lastly, 
                        wings and engines are sent to the assembly factory, that produce the airplane. Produced airplanes are
                        sent to a warehouse, where they will sell the airplanes (with fixed interval or at random). 
                        The warehouse also have a maximum capacity and have to stop the production when it is full. Before all, we were asked 
                        to think about the system's conception, by making a UML class diagram and sequence diagrams for important operations.
