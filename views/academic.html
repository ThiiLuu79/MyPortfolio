                    <p>As part of the <b>High Performance Databases (LOG660)</b> course, we were tasked with developing a Full Stack application named <b>Webflix</b>, 
                        allowing clients to rent movies in accordance with their subscriptions. Our data management required the utilization of an Oracle database, 
                        and interaction with this data was achieved through an object-oriented program. 
                        This assignment was structured in two phases. 
                        <br>
                        In the initial phase, we focused on designing class and relational diagrams for the application, 
                        tailored to various use cases. Additionally, we were responsible for importing a vast amount of data into the database from an XML file containing 
                        thousands of entries.
                        <br>
                        For the second phase of this assignment, our task was to design and develop a user interface (UI) for the application. Within this interface, 
                        clients could log in to access detailed information about movies, actors and directors. Moreover, clients with eligible subscriptions had the ability to rent movies.

                    The execution of this algorithm involved a multifaceted process, commencing with the construction of a character frequency table derived from the contents of a file.
                    Subsequently, we embarked on the creation of the Huffman tree based on this frequency table, followed by the generation of the Huffman code from the resulting tree.
                    The culmination of our efforts lay in the encoding and decoding of files utilizing the generated Huffman code.

                    <p>As part of the <b>Object-Oriented Programming and Conception (LOG121)</b> course, we were tasked with the development of a simulated production chain dedicated to manufacturing airplanes. 
                        This intricate simulation involved the orchestration of various factories essential for airplane production. 
                        For instance, the creation of metal necessitated the operation of metal factories, followed by the transportation of metal to wing and engine factories for the assembly of these crucial components. 
                        The final step in this intricate process involved sending wings and engines to an assembly factory responsible for crafting the complete airplane.
                        The completed airplanes were then directed to a warehouse, from which they would be strategically introduced into the market, either at fixed intervals or randomly.
                        Notably, the warehouse was designed with a maximum capacity, prompting the suspension of production activities when this threshold was reached.
                        Prior to the implementation phase, our undertaking commenced with a thoughtful consideration of system conception. 
                        This involved the creation of UML class diagrams and sequence diagrams, meticulously outlining the key operations integral to the functionality of the system.
