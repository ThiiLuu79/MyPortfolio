          <p>For this project, I used my knowledge in WordPress to create a simple buisiness website about puppies who provides
            supports for other puppies. This was a fun project, because it made me realized that there are multiple ways to create a website.

          <p>This simple website is a page where I can display all of my drawing projects. This time, I wanted to
            use the Bootstrap framework to create this page. By working on this project, I realized how much easier
            it is to create components for a webpage with Bootstrap. I learned how to create a responsive navigation bar, design a card layout,
            build a carousel and work efficiently with grids.

          Koha's OPAC is an interface where the clients can do multiple tasks, such as reserve an item, search for a specific item, and more. I had a lot of fun
          while working on this project, since I've always love to develop websites and improve my creativity.</p>

          <p>Even though this project has many flaws, I am proud to present it. This is by far the hardest
          website that I have been working on. In this project, I decided to recreate ÉTS University's
          homepage <a href="https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/home" target="_blank">(original page)</a>, with HTML and CSS only <b>(no JavaScript)</b>.
          This project was very challenging, because it was my first time recreating a complex webpage from scratch.
          If I have more time to work on it, I would make my website look better on mobile devices,
          since this website is <b>not responsive on smaller screens</b>.</p>

          <p>Wanting to improve my skills in CSS, I participated in the <b>"CSS Zen Garden Challenge"</b>.
          In this challenge, we all started with the same HTML file, except that we have to make our own CSS to style the homepage <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/214/page2/" target="blank">(original page)</a>, without modifying the HTML. This was a
          perfect project for me, because it taught me a lot about various CSS properties. Not only I was very proud of my work,
          but I could also see what other developers made, which I found really interesting.</p>

          <p>For my first website, I created a page that represents a tea shop, named TiTiTea.
          Clients can order tea, rate the place and even apply to open positions. By making this website, I've
          learned a lot of important skills in web developing. First, I learned how to design a page.
          Then, I discoverd how to make the website interact with the client. For instance, if the client
          doesn't fill all the required fields in a form, a message will show up. Finally,
          I'm able to store the data inputted by the client into a database and show them that
          their request has been submitted and sent to the back-end.</p>
